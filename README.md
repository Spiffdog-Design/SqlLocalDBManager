# SqlLocalDBManager
Makes management of local SqlLocalDb instances easier by wrapping sqllocaldb.exe in a GUI.

Fire up the application.  It will initially prompt for the location of sqllocaldb.exe.  If you are using Visual Studio 2015, it should automatically point you at the default save location.  If not, well, go find it.  This is a free utility.  You get what you pay for.

It performs most common tasks including: create, delete, start, stop, and getting instance info.

Enjoy.
